## LCD Display

* This will display the water level in the tank and alerts like low water level indication, a tank full, etc.

## Power

* Electric power supply to the microcontroller and Relay to drive the sensor and water pump.

## MicroController

* It is the heart of the system where it controlls the sensors to fetch water level, display the status and to control the water pump.

## Water Pump (Actuator)

* To pump water from the ground and fill the water in the tank.

## Water level sensor

* This will sense the water level in the tank and send it to the microcontroller.

## LED Indication

* This will indicate that the water pump is turned on or off.


## Manual ON-OFF Switch

* Manual switch will allow the user to control the water pump from the user end.

## Automatic/manual control switch

* This is a single toggle switch that toggles between automatic and manual mode.
