# M2_WATERLEVELCONTROL_SYSTEM

# INTRODUCTION

## DESCRIPTION

* The Automatic Water Filling System is capable to start and stop the water pump to fill the overhead water tank according to the water level in that tank. 
* Usually, we turn the water pump "on" to fill the tank and forgot to turn it "off" at that moment water overflows from that tank which leads to a lot of wastage of water and electricity.
* In this project, the sensor will sense the level of water in the tank, Based on that the controller will set the water pump to turn "on" and "off" when required. 
* The Heater will generate the heat and an LCD will show requested the temperature.
* The Project Consists of an ATmega328 microcontroller along with a temperature sensor, Pushbutton, Heat generator, LED and LCD, etc.
